# Simple Summary: Understanding Hexadecimal and Its Use in Networking

This video talks about how to convert numbers between binary, hexadecimal, and decimal formats — especially how to change hexadecimal numbers into decimal numbers. These number systems are important because computers and networks use them to identify devices and addresses.

If you’re not sure how to convert between binary and decimal, there are other videos that explain that first — you should watch those too.

## What is Hexadecimal and Why Is It Important?

- Hexadecimal (or "hex") is a way to write numbers using 16 symbols: 0-9 and A-F.
- In networking, hexadecimal is very important because it’s used in **MAC addresses** — unique codes that identify every device on a network.
- Hexadecimal is also used in **IPv6 addresses**, the newer kind of internet addresses.

## Easy Explanation of Hexadecimal by Comparing to Binary and Decimal

- Binary numbers use only two values: 0 and 1. All numbers are made from these two.
- Decimal numbers use ten values: 0 through 9.
- Hexadecimal uses sixteen values: 0-9 and then A, B, C, D, E, F.
- Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to a decimal value:
  - A = 10
  - B = 11
  - C = 12
  - D = 13
  - E = 14
  - F = 15
- Remembering these helps you understand hexadecimal easily.

## Converting Hexadecimal to Binary (and Vice Versa)

- Each hexadecimal digit converts to exactly four binary digits (bits).
- For example:
  - Hex `F` = Binary `1111`
  - Hex `0` = Binary `0000`
- So, for larger numbers like IP addresses, you break the number into groups of four bits and convert each group to hex.
- You can verify conversions using tools like the Windows calculator in Programmer mode.

## Decimal and Hexadecimal Values Are Closely Related

- Decimal 0 equals hexadecimal 0, decimal 1 equals hexadecimal 1, decimal 2 equals hexadecimal 2, and so on.
- This continues up to decimal 9 equals hexadecimal 9.
- After 9, decimal 10 equals hexadecimal A, 11 = B, 12 = C, 13 = D, 14 = E, and 15 = F.
- These are key values to remember when working with hex numbers.

## Examples to Help Understand

- For example, decimal 228 can be converted to binary and then to hex by splitting binary into groups of four bits.
- The Windows calculator in programmer mode can help confirm these conversions easily.
- Another example: decimal 255 converts to binary `11111111`, which converts to hex `FF`.
- When working with IP addresses, you split each octet into two groups of four bits and convert each group to hexadecimal.

## Reversing Binary and Hexadecimal Values

- In this course, you also get access to a decimal, binary, and hexadecimal converter tool.
- An IP address in decimal can be converted into four groups of 8 binary digits and their equivalent hexadecimal digits.
- You can also see the **reversed** versions of these numbers.
- For example, if the decimal number is 0, its reversed binary and hexadecimal are also 0.
- If you reverse the bits in binary, the result changes accordingly in decimal and hexadecimal.
- The reverse operation is based on flipping the order of the binary digits.
- This helps understand how bits and hex values relate and transform when reversed.
- Calculator tools can help convert between these formats and show reversed values for practice.

## Practical Example: Finding MAC Addresses on Your Computer

- On a Windows computer, you can open a command prompt and type `ipconfig /all`.
- This shows a list of all your network devices and their details.
- You’ll see your network card’s MAC address written in hexadecimal.
- This MAC address is like a name tag for your device on the network.

---

## How IP Addresses and MAC Addresses Work Together

- When your computer communicates with other devices, it uses IP addresses to find them.
- But under the hood, it needs MAC addresses to actually send the data.
- You can "ping" another device to test connection — the ping shows the IP address, and your computer finds the corresponding MAC address.
- This helps ensure data goes to the right place.

---

## Changing Your MAC Address

- Sometimes, you might want to change your MAC address manually.
- On Windows, you can go into the network settings and change the MAC address.
- Changing it might disconnect your internet temporarily but can be useful for testing or privacy.
- On network routers (like Cisco routers), you can also change MAC addresses using commands.

---

## Why Learning Hexadecimal Helps You

- Understanding hexadecimal makes it easier to work with network devices and troubleshoot.
- You can see and recognize MAC addresses and IP addresses more clearly.
- Knowing how these conversions work is a basic skill for network administrators and IT professionals.

## Important Note

- This video focuses on the importance of hexadecimal and how it relates to MAC and IP addresses.
- It doesn’t teach how to convert hexadecimal to binary or decimal step-by-step — that’s for other videos.

**In short:** Hexadecimal numbers are everywhere in networking — from your computer’s unique MAC address to the IP addresses it uses to communicate. Knowing what hex is and how it works helps you understand and manage networks better.
